# Udacity Project - Find The Pairs Memory Game

This game was built in April 2018, as part of the [Udacity Nanodegree web developer course](https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001); using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

*Please note this is a work in progress and further functionality will be added as I development my programming knowledge and skills.*

### Introduction

This project came with some starter code, HTML and CSS styling which displayed a static version of the Game. The project JavaScript file included the [Knuth-Suffle function](https://github.com/Daplie/knuth-shuffle).

The goal for all students was to convert a static web page, into an interactive memory game. This project required modifying HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

For a detailed look at the requirement and specifications, take a look at the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/591/view).
